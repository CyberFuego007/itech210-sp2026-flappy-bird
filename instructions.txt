Currently whe you play the game, if the bird touches a pipe, the game is
immediately over.  However there is a concept of lives already in the game
as demonstrated by the birds down in the lower left corner of the screen.

Your assignment is to implement the lives system.

you will use if statements to check for when the bird collides with a pipe.
Once that collision happens, instead of being an immediate game over, the 
player will lose one life and become immune to the pipes for a short bit.

Once the player reaches 0 lives, then the game over sequence will take affect
like normal.

Once you have completed this task, plaease feel free to play with the game to 
make it your own before turning in.  YOu can use the website https://opengameart.org
to get sprites for the bird, the pipes, the background, or even new music.

You can also play with the way scoring works or the speed.
